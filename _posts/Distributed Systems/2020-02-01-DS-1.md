### Definition of a Distributed System

|                                                                               |

| 💡 [Tannenbaum] – A collection of autonomous computing elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system |

  - Explanation: <span class="underline">A collection of elements</span>
    that as a user myself can see the connection of the system as a
    <span class="underline">one single system</span>. - one single
    coherent view
  - **Autonomous computing elements** → then you think about nodes\! Nodes
    could be hardware or software side of things → nodes need to talk
    and collaborate with each other\!
  - Because you have number of nodes, each machine has its own block (time
    wise)→ hard to have a global clock. Hence, those gotta synchronise →
    concept of **TIME**\!\!
  - Need to communicate w/ each other through msgs → these msgs need to go
    through network\!
  - **the idea of network is important\!\!**

| 💡 [Colouris] – A collection of autonomous computing elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system |

  - Collection of network elements are networked, and communicate via
    message passing
  - Single coherent system – nodes as a whole is dealing with one
    system. No matter where when and how the interaction takes place.
  - Examples
      - You access mobile phone and you access a server, but you have no
        idea with where the computation is taking place.
      - Q : Do we know where google services are stored?
          - Nope we don’t\! → it should be irrelevant to an application.
      - They replicate your data. 3 copies securely stored. → the fact
        that data is replicated
  - Transparency is KEY\!

|                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💡 **Transparency** : concealment from the user of the separated components in a distributed system so that its seen as a whole rather than as a collection of independent components |

### Examples of Dist. sys
  - The internet/ intranets – cluster of computers connected
      - Doesn’t fulfil the <span class="underline">transparency</span> –
        as it is easy to guess the IP. So you know exactly where and what
  - The world wide web – to have access to data, information and
    knowledge
  - A cellular mobile phone – interesting one\! We are travelling from
    Leeds to London in a train. My communication is handled
    transparently through the journey\! → is a true distributed system as
    it fulfils the concept of
    **<span class="underline">transparency</span>**

  - Google Hamina – a data centre for google in Finland in a middle of
    nowhere by the seaside.
      - Such large data centre, so cooling system is needed.
          - Google uses water from sea to cool the centre. → renewable
            energy
      - Data needs to be stored somewhere. It is distributed over a
        number of machines so they gotta communicate, so latency is v
        important & always an issue. And then they need to process this
        data
      - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33334078/74332806-7d3bfe80-4d8e-11ea-9c3a-eda851942596.png)



### Middleware
  - 4 machines are running at the same time. && Each machine has its own
    OS, and msg passing algorithm.
  - Middleware (distributed system a) is the key layer – sits btwn
    application and OS
      - Layer that makes the OS look like a single coherent system
      - It contains commonly used components and functions that all
        applications can use
  - The middleware extends over multiple machines


### Challenges for Distributed Systems
  - Architecture, performance, synchronization, security, transparency,
    protocols, data management, reliability, fault tolerance, failure
    \!\!
      - Would it fail all together?


### Goals for Distributed Systems

1. **Sharing of resources**  data, files, services, networks etc
    1. Cloud based shared storage
        - Data could be stored on different remote machines, and synchronization is need to keep it up to date
    2. File sharing Peer to Peer networks – concept of transparency
        - E.g. BitTorrent – spreading of a file through many peer computer nodes. Since every participant is a content provider, no dependency on a single party
    3. Shared mail services (office 365) – again the fact that his email box is somewhere on the cloud. Yet he can send and receive email from a local machine → transparency
    4. Shared web hosting
        - Content distribution network → NETFLIX! They will ensure that what we need to access is in the server. And it looks up the closet server (for low latency)
        - interesting is the fact that data is duplicated here and there
        - concept of outsourcing seems to be common

2. **Transparency**
    - We have machine, OS, middleware, kernel → and we need them to talk to each other!
    - So far we know network services as socket programming, TCP
        - Socket- transparency is limited.
            - I am a server and I’m writing in this socket – as my client will need to look at where exactly the server is. Also we need to know the port no. → v limited transparency
        - In this module, we gonna ensure that the transparency is actually there → this is where **middleware** comes in!

    💡 Goal: To hide heterogeneity of the underlying platforms from applications

    - **Q: What do we mean by transparency?**
        - **Access** – if I look at computers in the network, some are in Windows, Linux, java, python. So how do they talk to each other? → hide differences in machine architecture!
        - **Location** – interesting – if I access a service, I have no idea where its coming from.
        - **Migration**possible for data/ service to move from one to another. One way to access the service is all that matters to me.
            - Phone call, regardless of ppl moving, mobile will allow us to keep talking.
        - **Relocation** – object may be moved while in use. Entire site may have been moved from one data centre to another.
        - **Replication** – we don’t know google has 3 copies of our data!
        - **Concurrency** – data may be shared by several users at the same time
        - **Failure** – Even if the object fails, my application shouldn’t fail!

3. **Middleware and Openness**
    - Concept of openness (free interaction) is the key – irrespective of the underlying environment.
        - They have diff architecture, but brings it together is the middleware!
            - The middleware we provide have same programming interface!
                - So the interface that they communicate with each other are known
                - As a common protocol so that Windows can talk to Linux
            - Interoperate – two apps, they talk to each other to interoperate by relying on a specified common standard!
                - One key that will make this two systems interoperate, is the concept of **standards !!–** it brings ppl together, and if I’m Microsoft and there’s a standard out there**,** make sure that my app can interoperate with other apps
                - This will ensure that in DS, these apps could be implemented and interoperate with other apps
            - Portability – to support data program written in x and y architecture
            - Extensible – can take this programming interfaces, and extend it yourself the notion of interoperability and portability are fulfilled

4. **Scalability –** whether a DS scales in terms of
    - Size – We can add more users, machines, and resource, and it remains effective after a significant increase in the resources
        - Scalable in terms of users, machines, processes running in the machine
        - E.g. internet is designed to scale.
        - Poor scalability if cost of supporting n users is worse than O(n) → info needs to be organized hierarchically! O(logn)
            - If the structure is in array, from 0-n, can you find exact x element! → will take v long
            - However if we use tree structure the computation time will go down→ Hierarchical
        - PG 18 – See the growth of number of domains and how it scaled! More than 1 billion now
            - It rly shows that the internet is there to grow – but we do not see that happening, and we don’t see any difference in accessing the data we need!
- **!!** Geographically – Users and resources can lie far apart, but the communication delays is hardly noticed
    - Nodes in Leeds, Dublin, London
    - Geography will bring 2 imp aspect – bandwidth and latency!!!!!
    - Distance itself will affect the response time – depending on the congestion of the network
- !! Administration – number of administrative domains
    - Can still be easily managed even if it spans many independent administrative organizations.
    - Leeds Sheffield and York bringing together the resources → 3 admins can have conflicting system with diff security policies → this will impact how we use the dist sys. But keep in mind that this could be problematic
- → concept of geographic and admin is v imp!

### Scaling Techniques - 1. Hiding communication latencies

- Client machine on LHS and server RHS. Suppose that we input in client form, and this form is sent to server and is checked. Then server process the form.
- Second eg says what if the client itself checks the form? If its correct THEN send
- → Diff when it comes to network resources and how its implemented. It how we DESIGN the dis sys

### Scaling techniques – 2. DNS

- The name table for internet was a single master file – centralized approach so it didn’t scale well. And we have 1 billion machines!! → gotta think how we gonna structure!
- Soooo the DNS is a table that is distributed, and is administered locally. → hierarchical nature.
    - If we have 1 bil, but 2 bil – it still works. Because of its hierarchical nature
- E.g. DNS structure – [2 pdf 22]
    - There are 3 zones, 1 2 3. Generic/countries ~~ local administrative
    - Lets say we are looking for computing department in uni of ams
        - We first look for nl – z1
        - When we get to nl, we wanna look up where ams uni is? - z2
        - And then we found the uni, and access server for cs – z3
        - → hierarchical, and it takes short time
    - Q; how often is DNS gonna change? Which zone has info that barely changes.
        - Zone 1 doesn’t change often – unlikely ull have a new country. But down zone 3, organizational layer, it changes v regularly

### Scaling technique – 3. Replication

- Replication of data bc components of DS is likely to fail. So we want higher availability,
- **Pros**
    - To increase availability for when it fails
    - Shares the load btwn components so that it could be accessed
    - Can hide communication latency problem
        - E.g. Netflix, we stream it from the server near you! Less latency
- **Drawbacks**
    - Multiple copies could be inconsistent. you gotta change and update ALL copies
    - To keep the copies consistent, u’ll need ur servers to communicate w each other → you require global synchronization after each modification. → VERY imp
    - Precludes large scale solutions – number of copies and servers u may have, and geography!! Will be easy to replicate things locally, lots of bandwidth with low latency. But in global scale, you may have low bandwidth, high latency → issue that u need to keep in mind

**Summary**

- Defined a distributed system as a collection of independent computers giving the appearance of a single coherent system
- Introduced challenges as they apply to distributed systems
